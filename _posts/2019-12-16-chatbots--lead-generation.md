## Help understand the audience

It�s hard to give a present to your new neighbor but easy when you�re selecting a gift for your close friend. Why so? Because you know your friend inside out.
Likewise, selling products to customers can be hard if you don�t know their interests. Chatbot eases this hard job.
A chatbot makes it easy to help you understand your audience. It enables you to identify the product interests, likes and dislikes of consumers. This also improves lead engagement.
A chatbot can conduct surveys, ask questions and quizzes whenever users talk to it. Thus, helps you get a better idea about your best and least-performing products too.
An eCommerce store can use a sales chatbot to increase lead generation.
For example, if a user visits your website, the bot can ask his interests. If the user enters the wristwatch, the bot can show the best wristwatches you�ve in your inventory.

## Segmenting the audience

Segmentation plays a major role in keeping your content relevant. It also escalates your lead generation strategy.
Suggesting US residents a tour package, valid for the Indian citizens can spoil the customers� experience.
Your chatbot can segment the audience based on the data they provided. It does so on many factors like demographics, interests, age, gender, etc.
This helps you in lead nurturing too. If a customer belongs to a particular category, you can deal with him with the solution you have for that section.
For example, if a user celebrates Christmas, your bot can show the best presents available for the customer to give at Christmas.
This can be very impactful since it targets the audience with a fitting solution.

## Building relationships

Trust is the foundation of a relationship. A chatbot helps you build that trust by having a regular talk to the audience.
It engages subscribers by providing instant support and always being available to help them. This makes the users think that there�s a brand they can always rely on.

We�ve various chatbot lead generation strategies but this is the one which must be followed. For building a lasting relationship with customers, you can do this with chatbots to increase lead generation.

## Replace forms

Filling out forms has become a tedious task to do. Neither it�s exciting nor engaging. Chatbots can replace these forms in a super-effective way to generate leads cleverly.
It asks user details within the conversation as the user goes further. This lessens the friction and streamlines the data collection process for you. Hence boosts your lead generation strategy if a customer doesn�t have to make efforts to fill info.
Users find it easy to give information in reply to an answer. Having a chatbot to collect lead information doesn�t bore a user.
Build a chatbot that can ask any user�s name, email, phone, address and more.
By providing autofill options, you can make the customer do less typing, hence, fasten the detail giving process too.

## Educate the audience

Education is an essential element in the lead generation process. Without having knowledge about the product, the customer won�t buy it. This can be made easy with a chatbot.
Many organizations are using chatbots to teach their audience and make them regular subscribers. Even I�ve subscribed to many platforms on facebook messenger to read blog articles on my favorite topics.
This makes the blog reading much easier. By just entering the term you want the blog to read, you�ll get the articles in a few seconds.
Chatbots let user find the content you�ve on your website easily.
If you�ve a blogging platform, your bot can provide the feature to a user to simply type �Content Marketing� to get posts about Content Marketing.
