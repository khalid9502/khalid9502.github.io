[37% of Americans](https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/11-amazing-facts-you-might-not-know-about-chatbots-8cdf331181f8) say they’d buy something from a chatbot.

So for the holiday shopping season in 2017, LEGO introduced shoppers to Ralph.

Unlike an ill-placed LEGO brick under the unassuming toe, Ralph was a hit with shoppers.

Shoppers weren’t the only fans. LEGO pulled in nearly 2X higher average order value with Ralph on their side.

So who is Ralph?! Press play to see Ralph’s moves.

Ralph is a Facebook Messenger bot, a virtual personal shopper for any one looking for the perfect gift for a little builder friend or family.

And Ralph posts some seriously [impressive marketing metrics](https://www.facebook.com/business/success/2-lego):

*3.4X higher return on ad spend for click-to-Messenger ads (compared to ads that linked to the LEGO website)
*71% lower cost per purchase when clicking through to the Messenger experience
*1.9X higher value for website purchases made from click-to-Messenger ads
