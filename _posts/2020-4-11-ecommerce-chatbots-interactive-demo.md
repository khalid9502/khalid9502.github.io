[37% of Americans](https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/11-amazing-facts-you-might-not-know-about-chatbots-8cdf331181f8) say they’d buy something from a chatbot.

So for the holiday shopping season in 2017, LEGO introduced shoppers to Ralph.

Unlike an ill-placed LEGO brick under the unassuming toe, Ralph was a hit with shoppers.

Shoppers weren’t the only fans. LEGO pulled in nearly 2X higher average order value with Ralph on their side.

So who is Ralph?! Press play to see Ralph’s moves.

## Leveraging Messenger Bot Funnels for Explosive Ecommerce Return

Ecommerce businesses need a constant supply of engaged shoppers who will purchase … and buy again.

In this Interactive Demo we'll scratch the surface of how Bots on messenger can skyrocket your revenue by going through:

1. Part 1: How bots can showcase your products
2. Part 2: Product recommendation through a Messenger bots
2. Part 3: Connecting shoppers with your messenger bot
2. Part 4: How bots can segment your contact list based on individual shoppers interests and needs
2. Part 5: How Bots can announce promotions and sales using sponsored messages
2. Part 6: How Bots can remarket to abandoned cart shoppers using Facebook click-to-Messenger ads

## Part 1. How bots can showcase your products

When a user engages with your bot, they can browse your products without ever leaving the Messenger app.

First, they can choose the category of product they’re shopping for.

Then, after selecting a category, they can scroll through individual product listings.

These listings can include photos, descriptions, and even links to the corresponding product pages on your ecommerce site.

This makes for extremely mobile-friendly shopping, and can help speed up the process of getting your shoppers to the right products.

When a user finds a product they like, they can head straight to your site to learn more — and ideally, make a purchase.

Plus, these links open directly within the Messenger app. So if a shopper changes their mind after visiting your site, they can keep engaging with your chatbot until they find another option

## Part 2: Product recommendation through a Messenger bots

You can make browsing your products even more engaging by creating funnels that walk shoppers through the process.

Ask a series of questions to help them arrive at the exact product they are looking for. This is how LEGO jumped AOV 1.9X — by giving shoppers confidence that they found exactly what they were looking for.

Another example of the guided question strategy for product recommendations is Shop Spring’s product recommendation Facebook chatbot:

First, Shop Spring’s ecommerce bot asks whether they’re looking for men’s women’s items or men’s items, as well as which product category they’d like to browse.

Once the shopper indicates that they’re shoe shopping, it offers a few sub-categories to narrow down the options, and asks for a general price range.

Based on this information, it delivers a product carousel with all of the items that match that description, along with links to the product pages for each.

This makes shopping with the company on Messenger a fast, easy, and convenient process — and makes it all the more likely that their customers will take advantage of this channel.

## Part 3: Connecting shoppers with your messenger bot

With your bot set to showcase your products and provide personalized product recommendations, you’re ready to build your Messenger contact list.

There are four ways you can make this happen.

### 1. Click-to-Messenger Ads

Facebook Click-to-Messenger ads appear in users’ news feeds and across the Instagram, Messenger, Audience Network and Facebook apps family like any other Facebook Ads campaign.

But instead of instructing those users to immediately visit your website and make a purchase, a Click-to-Messenger CTA connects people with your business in Facebook Messenger.

After clicking the CTA, they’ll receive an automated bot message from your page.
