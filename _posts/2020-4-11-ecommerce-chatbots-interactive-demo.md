[37% of Americans](https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/11-amazing-facts-you-might-not-know-about-chatbots-8cdf331181f8) say they’d buy something from a chatbot.

So for the holiday shopping season in 2017, LEGO introduced shoppers to Ralph.

Unlike an ill-placed LEGO brick under the unassuming toe, Ralph was a hit with shoppers.

Shoppers weren’t the only fans. LEGO pulled in nearly 2X higher average order value with Ralph on their side.

So who is Ralph?! Press play to see Ralph’s moves.

Ralph is a Facebook Messenger bot, a virtual personal shopper for any one looking for the perfect gift for a little builder friend or family.

* 3.4X higher return on ad spend for click-to-Messenger ads (compared to ads that linked to the LEGO website)
* 71% lower cost per purchase when clicking through to the Messenger experience
* 1.9X higher value for website purchases made from click-to-Messenger ads

## Leveraging Messenger Bot Funnels for Explosive Ecommerce Return

Ecommerce businesses need a constant supply of engaged shoppers who will purchase … and buy again.

In this Interactive Demo we'll scratch the surface of how Bots on messenger can skyrocket your revenue by going through:

1. Part 1: How bots can showcase your products
2. Part 2: Product recommendation through a Messenger bots
2. Part 3: Connecting shoppers with your messenger bot
2. Part 4: How bots can segment your contact list based on individual shoppers interests and needs
2. Part 5: How Bots can announce promotions and sales using sponsored messages
2. Part 6: How Bots can remarket to abandoned cart shoppers using Facebook click-to-Messenger ads

## Part 1. How bots can showcase your products

When a user engages with your bot, they can browse your products without ever leaving the Messenger app.

First, they can choose the category of product they’re shopping for.

Then, after selecting a category, they can scroll through individual product listings.

These listings can include photos, descriptions, and even links to the corresponding product pages on your ecommerce site.

This makes for extremely mobile-friendly shopping, and can help speed up the process of getting your shoppers to the right products.

When a user finds a product they like, they can head straight to your site to learn more — and ideally, make a purchase.

Plus, these links open directly within the Messenger app. So if a shopper changes their mind after visiting your site, they can keep engaging with your chatbot until they find another option

## Part 2: Product recommendation through a Messenger bots

You can make browsing your products even more engaging by creating funnels that walk shoppers through the process.

Ask a series of questions to help them arrive at the exact product they are looking for. This is how LEGO jumped AOV 1.9X — by giving shoppers confidence that they found exactly what they were looking for.

Another example of the guided question strategy for product recommendations is Shop Spring’s product recommendation Facebook chatbot:

First, Shop Spring’s ecommerce bot asks whether they’re looking for men’s women’s items or men’s items, as well as which product category they’d like to browse.

Once the shopper indicates that they’re shoe shopping, it offers a few sub-categories to narrow down the options, and asks for a general price range.

Based on this information, it delivers a product carousel with all of the items that match that description, along with links to the product pages for each.

This makes shopping with the company on Messenger a fast, easy, and convenient process — and makes it all the more likely that their customers will take advantage of this channel.

## Part 3: Connecting shoppers with your messenger bot

With your bot set to showcase your products and provide personalized product recommendations, you’re ready to build your Messenger contact list.

There are four ways you can make this happen.

### 1. Click-to-Messenger Ads

Facebook Click-to-Messenger ads appear in users’ news feeds and across the Instagram, Messenger, Audience Network and Facebook apps family like any other Facebook Ads campaign.

But instead of instructing those users to immediately visit your website and make a purchase, a Click-to-Messenger CTA connects people with your business in Facebook Messenger.

After clicking the CTA, they’ll receive an automated bot message from your page.

In your ecommerce bot ad, have a clear call-to-action that the user can take.

For example, you might include a link to your store, along with a discount code for 20% off a purchase.

It doesn’t matter what, exactly you ask recipients to do, though — the important thing is that they engage in some way.

Because as soon as they do, they’ll be added to your list of Messenger contacts, and you can continue sending them messages on Messenger.

This approach is particularly effective if you use custom audiences to target your ads to users who’ve already engaged with your website, your Facebook page, or a customer audience list of emails.

Convert your warm prospects list who are familiar with your brand into Messenger contacts who are much more likely to click your CTA and engage in Messenger.

You can also use the lookalike audience option to target users who have similar interests or demographics to your existing customer base.

This way, you can expand your Messenger contact list, but still focus on users who are more likely than the average person to be interested in connecting with your brand.	

### 2. Free Facebook Comment Guard

Comment Guards are another easy and effective way to turn engaged commenters into Messenger contacts.

It lets you automatically message all of the users who comment on a specific post on your business’s Facebook page. It turns your Facebook fans into Messenger contacts you can message.

For example, Natural Gear Camouflage added a Comment Guard to this Facebook post, offering a 20% off coupon to anyone who commented on it.

Then, every user who commented automatically received the following message:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/10001_comment_guard_messege.png)

In this example, they required the user to reply “Yes” to see the answer to the question posed in their post.

This is an extremely easy thing to ask of their shoppers, and one that most users will be willing to do.

And that’s important — because much like with Click-to-Messenger ads, every user who responds to that first message is automatically added to your Messenger contact list.

Once they’re on your list, you can continue communicating with them beyond simply responding to their comments on your page’s posts — and work on turning those engaged commenters into loyal customers.

### 3. Website Chat Widget

Website chat widgets are a great way to convert your ecommerce website’s visitors into Messenger contacts.

Many shoppers are already accustomed to using live chat widgets on the ecommerce sites they buy from, like this one from Lincoln Davies Building Supply Company:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/10001_website_widget.png)

But chat widgets don’t necessarily need to be staffed by live support agents. You can use chatbots to offer your customer 24/7 answers and support.

And if you create your widget using the Messenger interface, every visitor who interacts with your chatbot will be added as a contact on the platform.

You can continue sending information and updates even they leave your site, with the goal of ultimately bringing them back for a purchase.

### 4. Links to Bots & QR Codes

Every dialogue has a direct URL link that will plop the user straight into a particular bot conversation.

If your brand has a physical retail space, you can turn a link into a QR codes that’s easy to scan while a customer is in the store — an excellent way to convert foot traffic into online connections.

When a customer scans yours (whether from an in-store display, a checkout screen, or a window flyer), they’ll automatically be connected as a contact.
